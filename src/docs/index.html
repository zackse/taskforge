    This is the main website for Taskforge. It contains minimal documentation
    and all documentation should really be written in the rst files in the repo.
    This is more of a Marketing or a "first look" at Taskforge and is merely a
    landing page.

                <div class="container text-left" >
                    <p>
                        Taskforge has many competitors and all of them are great
                        choices for task management. So why build yet another "todo
                        app"?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The answer is simple, most task management applications
                        require you duplicate data into them from other sources.
                        Whether by work or personal preference our actual tasks
                        are managed in different sources today. Whether that be
                        JIRA, GitHub, Trello etc. the teams and people we
                        interact with rarely use the same solution as we do, and
                        it's even less likely that you'll be able to use the
                        same systems at work and on projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The downside of all this? <strong>These systems
                        put the responsibility on you</strong> to duplicate that
                        information into a format that you can digest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the problem that Taskforge solves. It aggregates
                        and integrates with existing systems and provides a
                        unified interface for all the various tasks systems
                        you're required to interact with.
