Taskforge Designs
=================

These are all of the design documents for Taskforge features. Not every feature
was big enough to warrant a design and these are living documents, i.e. updated
as necessary to reflect reality.

They are reference material for building a feature and used as a place for
discussion to occur before a feature is built.
